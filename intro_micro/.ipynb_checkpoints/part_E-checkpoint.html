                So far in this course we've examined the way we coordinate large groups of people to minimize opportunity cost. In Part A we motivated this search using the realization that minimizing opportunity cost can make everyone better off simultaneously. In Part B we showed that in some cases markets can be an effective coordination device. In Part C we showed that externalities undermine the efficiency of markets but that we could correct this type of market failure using correctly calibrated government policies. In Part D we introduced game theory to help understand the strategic interaction that leads to market failure around Public Goods and Common Resources. We even developed some tools like voting and enforceable permits which can go a long way to minimizing market failure. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This course we charted through economic theory has relied on our loose models of why buyers and sellers choose to interact. In Part A we introduced buyers' preferences with the demand curve and sellers' costs with the supply curve. Before investigating where buyers' preferences come from, in Part E we make the turn to examine the seller's incentives.
            </p>
            <p>
                To do this we first start with the same production function we used in the Four Quadrant PPF. We input labor and generate an output according to some internal process. Inputs are costly, so as we increase inputs, we increase output but we also increase cost. This relationship between quantity and costs gives us our core cost measures: <b>Average Total Cost (ATC)</b> and <b>Marginal Cost (MC)</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                We assume that the seller's aim to maximize their profits, simply Total Revenue minus Total Cost. And we found that the solution to the Firm's Profit Maximization Problem is to set quantity where MC = MR. The shape of MC depends on the shape of the production function. The shape of MR depends on how much power the firm exerts over the market. Part E is about how this market power changes the firm's decisions and how these decisions impact society.

                Once you've finished reading, take a look at the practice material and use the text as a resource when you need help. This way, you know what's most important, get to practicing quickly, and know where to find help when you innevitably get stuck.

                MiniExam E Demo is very similar to what you'll see on MiniExam E.

                This is a resource for you to use as you'd like. But here's my advice. Start by trying to solve MiniExam E Demo on your own. Then once you've worked through everything as best you're able, use the video and solutions to check your work. You're more than welcome to watch this video first, but you're not going to catch your weak points as easily, which is the main point.
