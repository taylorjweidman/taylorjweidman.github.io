    <!-- DESCRIPTION -->

            <p>
                In Part A we set up the landscape of what's possible. But we left with the question where on the PPF is best. Part B introduces markets as a way to arbitrate which point on the PPF we should choose. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We start by slipping in prices to develop <b>Supply</b> and <b>Demand</b>. We take these concepts to a market and ask where prices come from. With low prices we have a shortage, and both the seller and buyer have an incentive to raise prices. With high prices we have an excess, and both the seller and buyer have an incentive to lower prices. There is only one point when neither buyer nor seller wishes to raise or lower prices. This is when quantity demanded equals quantity supplied. This looks like all the spinach getting sold and no buyer going home empty handed. We call this <b>Market Clearing</b>, which happens when quantity supplied equals quantity demanded. There is only one price that makes this happen and is found when Demand and Supply intersect. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In competitive markets this set of incentives leads to the sum of Consumer Surplus and Producer Surplus, <b>Total Surplus</b>, being at its largest. This isn't true in every market, which we'll return to in Part C. But the competitive markets we face have this property, that the prices set by the market give us <b>Social Efficiency</b>, maximum Surplus Value.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Take a look at this excellent video from one of my favorite Youtube channels simulating a market.

                The place to start is with <a href="Textbook/chapter_4.pdf" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a>, <a href="Textbook/chapter_5.pdf" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, and <a href="Textbook/chapter_7.pdf" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a>. I recommend starting by skimming through the textbook quickly to develop an understanding of the scope of what's being discussed. Then reread in more detail.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Then once you've finished reading, take a look at the practice material, and use the text as a resource when you need help. This way, you know what's most important, get to practicing quickly, and know where to find help when you innevitably get stuck.

                This is a resource for you to use as you'd like. But here's my advice. Start by trying to solve MiniExam B Demo on your own. Then once you've worked through everything as best you're able, use the video and solutions to check your work. You're more than welcome to watch this video first, but you're not going to catch your weak points as easily, which is the main point.

                Video Note: An observant classmate of yours, Catie Meister, found a math error in the video calculating Deadweight Loss. It should be 121/12 instead of 121/3. The solutions have been updated. Nice work Catie!
