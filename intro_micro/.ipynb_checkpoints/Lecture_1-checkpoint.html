            <h3>Economics isn't <i>about</i> money</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            <p>
                Often when I hear about economics in popular culture or on the news it has to do with prices, stocks, market indicators, unemployment, maybe with a ticker tracking something financial. It can be important to communicate these things. Having some sense of how and whether people are able to get jobs gave us one view of one of the impacts of the Great Recession. And then again when Covid hit.

                These economic measures communicate some things to some people. Economics at base, however, isn't about money or unemployment.

            <p>
                Each of us has preferences. Unpopular opinion: I prefer carrot cake to chocolate cake. Send hate mail to econ@hatemail.org. I also prefer dark roast coffee to medium roast coffee. But I also prefer medium roast coffee to light roast coffee. I could keep going. I have preferences for most things in my life. And if you're human, you do too. I could ask you about most things and you'd be able to tell me which you prefer. You'd be able to rank them. All we have to do is list the choices from best to worst, assign them numbers, with larger numbers being more preferred, and this ordering represents our preferences.

            <h3>Scarcity</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            <p>
                But sorry if I'm the one to break it to you, we can't always have what we want most. Most people prefer a Tesla Model Y to a Honda Civic. But for many reasons not everyone right now can have a Model Y. And while we face financial constraints it's important to realize that scarcity like this is more basic than money.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even during the times in history when we didn't have money, human beings were still unable to have everything they wanted. There's always been tension between getting one thing or getting another. This happens both at an individual level and at a societal level. If we decided everyone should have a Tesla, it might be physically possible, but in doing so someone may go hungry. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Society faces all sorts of choices like how many Teslas to produce and who should get them. And this decision-making is necessary precisely because we have preferences AND we face scarcity. With preferences in the face of scarcity, we must make choices requiring tradeoffs.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the world economics lives in. Given that we are making choices in scarcity to maximize preferences, what should we do?

            <h3>Tradeoffs</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            <p>
                To get a better handle on choices, lets be a bit more sophisticated how we define tradeoffs. Lets say I give you the choice of ùê¥  OR  ùêµ . If you choose  ùê¥ , you can't have  ùêµ . If you choose  ùêµ , you can't have  ùê¥ . Economists define opportunity cost as the value of the next best alternative. This definition gives us handy conceptual traction here. If you choose  ùê¥ , your next best alternative is  ùêµ . So your opportunity cost of  ùê¥  is  ùêµ . And your opportunity cost of  ùêµ  is  ùê¥ . We‚Äôre going to use opportunity cost quite heavily as we build more sophisticated models.

            <h3>Molly's Opportunity Cost</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            <p>
                Let's build up some intuition for opportunity cost with a little example. Imagine Molly, a small scale organic farmer, is good at growing spinach and carrots on her  100  hectare farm. If she spends all her time growing spinach she can grow  45  tons per year. If instead she spends all her time growing carrots, she can grow  5  tons per year. If Molly were to switch from growing all carrots to all spinach, she would give up  5  tons of carrots and instead get  45  tons of spinach. So we‚Äôll set those two values equal and simplify. And that's it. Molly‚Äôs opportunity cost of  1  unit of carrots is  9  units of spinach. For every  1  unit of carrots she wants to grow, she‚Äôll have to give up  9  units of spinach.

                This concept of opportunity cost, and what happens when we try to minimize it, will become crucial to what we'll do later.

            <h3>Molly's Production Possibility Frontier</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            <p>
                There is a more systematic way to think about Molly‚Äôs farm. We've gone through and calculated Molly's opportunity cost for her farm. But Molly doesn't need to not choose either carrots OR spinach; she can choose any combination of the two crops. So let's go through and examine a range of crop choices she can make. Let's use an  ùë•,ùë¶  graph to plot how much of each crop model is harvesting as we move through a few crop choices. Let's use the vertical axis to represent her carrot harvest and the horizontal axis to represent her spinach harvest. We've already established that she can harvest  5  tons of carrots and  0  tons of spinach, or  0  tons of carrots and  45  tons of spinach.
            </p>
            <p>
                Based on her productivity numbers, if Molly plants carrots on half her land and spinach on the other half, she would have half of  5  tons of carrots and half of  45  tons of spinach. Let's also plot that on our  ùë•,ùë¶  graph.
            </p>

            <p>
                At this point you might wonder how Molly would choose how much of each to plant. Great question. We'll come back to it in later chapters. For now we're just gonna find what's possible to set up the trade-offs involved in our later models.
            </p>

            <p>
                As we running through more points its easy to see that any carrot and spinach combination Molly chooses lies on a line which we call the Production Possibility Frontier (PPF). Take a look at the range of other combinations. 
            </p>

        </div>
            <p>
                And guess what? Calculating the the slope of this relationship gives us her opportunity cost. To harvest  1  more unit of carrots Molly must havest  9  fewer units of spinach. The slope here is negative since we're giving one good up for the other, exactly what opportunity cost is capturing. This is really the trade-off captured by the opportunity cost and as we mentioned earlier it's embedded in the PPF relationship.

                This Production Possibility Fronteir relationship is what one person can do on their own. If this were the best one could do, the story would be pretty boring. And we'd be pretty close to finished with this class.
            </p>
            <p>
                But some foundational insights in the 1800s give us our first counter-intuitive punchline: we can actually do better! Simply by making better choices and coordinating with others we can excape the barier of the PPF.
            </p>
            <p>
                Showing how we do this requires some mathematics and a small detour into 1800s economic history. And that's exactly where we're going in the next few classes. This is Part A of the class, where we set up the landscape of everything that comes later in the semester.
