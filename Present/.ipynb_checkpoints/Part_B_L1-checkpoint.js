    "Use the arrows on the left to play through the animations. Use the arrows on the right to skip forward and back.",
    "We just built up a model showing us the landscape of what's possible. But we were left with a question: how do we choose which point on the frontier is better? That's the question we turn to here.",
    "We're going to begin to make an important but seemingly esoteric move here. Instead of conceiving of opportunity cost in terms of goods given up, as in spinach for carrots, we're going to slip money in as the units of opportunity cost. One way of thinking about this move is to think the opportunity cost of spinach as being in terms of carrots. If carrots carried some monetary value the value of the carrots given up to grow spinach would be in terms of money.",
    "This definition of opportunity cost what we call Marginal Cost: how much I get if I did something else instead. You'll notice the resemblance to opportunity cost. We've just simply introduced money as the units.",
    "Let's now look at just the spinach part of Molly's farm. Molly chooses how much spinach to plant. She can rent more or less land depending how much she wants to harvest.",
    "Let's say Molly is happy to grow 1000 pounds of spinach at a price of four dollars per pound. This is Molly's quantity supplied at four dollars, which we'll denote with Q subscript S as a function of four dollars.",
    "Let's plot this on the XY plane with the price of four dollars on the vertical and 1,000 pounds of spinach on the horizontal.",
    "What happens when the price of spinach goes up? Molly was happy with what she was doing. But now maybe she wants to rent more land to grow more spinach or use some of the land she uses to grow carrot land to grow spinach. And maybe she'll hire someone to tend to the new spinach. All this together, after the price increase it makes more sense for her to increase her spinach crop by shifting resources from other uses.",
    "What would happen if the price drops below $4.00? The quantity of spinach Molly would supply would go down because spinach is relatively less valuable than other uses of her land and labor. This positive relationship between prices and quantity is called the Law of Supply.",
    "Law of Supply: The quantity supplied of a good rises with its price.",
    "When we represent this relationship with a curve we call it the Individual Supply Curve.",
    "We're going to devote an entire portion of the class to thinking about Molly's opportunity costs more explicitly. But for now, we just need to know that Molly's supply curve of spinach is her Marginal Cost: The cost of adding one additional unit of spinach.",
    "What if adding one more unit of spinach became more costly? For example, what would happen if renting farmland increased?",
    "Her supply curve would also increase! The cost of each additional unit of spinach becomes more expensive since the input, land, has also become more expensive. So the Supply Curve, her Marginal Cost curve, increases.",
    "But it turns out Molly isn't the only farmer growing and selling spinach. If we want to think about all the available spinach, we need to look at other farmers' individual supply curves as well. You remember Andrew, right? The farmer next door. He also has an individual supply curve.",
    "His individual supply curve is a little steeper than Molly's, which means he's willing to increase his quantity supplied with price. But doesn't change his quantity supplied as responsively to prices as does Molly. We'll come back to this idea of responsiveness later.",
    "We can find his quantity supplied at these three prices by intersecting the prices with his individual supply curve.",
    "To account for the entire supply of spinach we need to include Andrew's individual supply curve. So lets take what he's growing at every price and add it with Molly's quantity supplied. When we add together all the farmers individual supply curves, we call this the Aggregate Market Supply Curve or sometimes simply Supply.",

    "Returning to supply curve shifters: what would happen if renting farmland became more costly?",
    "Since the supply curve represents the marginal cost in the market higher production costs would shift the supply curve up. The opposite would happen if cost went down the supply curve without also shift down. Check out chapter 4 for a deeper dive into the supply curve and the factors that shift it.",
    "Some Recap. Market Supply Curve is the sum of all individual supply curves.",
    "Some Recap. Higher costs shift the supply curves up. Lower costs shift the supply curve down.",
    "But there's a whole lot more, so check out Chapter 4.",
