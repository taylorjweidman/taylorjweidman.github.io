            <br>
            <div style="text-align:left">
                <p> Unfortunately, the model of markets we've used is incomplete. This week we will look at market failure: situations where markets fail to maximize surplus value. </p>
            </div>

                        Externalities are one example of a market failure within the market model: a cost or benefit impacting those not directly participating in the market. Externalities can be positive (e.g. a vaccine) or negative (e.g. carbon emissions).

            </div>
            <div style="text-align:left">
                <p> The solution to this problem is to get the people creating the externality to take the costs or benefits their actions create into account when they make their choices. Economists call this internalizing the externality and we'll look at a few options. </p>
                <br>
                <p> We'll also look at a particular type of externality present in goods that are rival but not-excludable: common resources. To do this requires a bit of game theory, which we'll pair with a simulation to capture some of the frustration involved with common resources. </p>

            <br>
            <div style="text-align:left">
                <p> Next we turn to seller's profit maximization decision, "The Firm's Problem" in markets more realistic than the model of perfect competition we've used so far. </p>

                        <p> Asking how firms make choices requires (unfortunately in my mind) doing some cost accounting. Cost curves come from the relationship between inputs and outputs, and we'll discuss the important relationships between these curves. </p>

            <div style="text-align:left">
                <p> We can then use the firms costs to return to our familiar model of supply and demand in competitive markets from the perspective of the seller's costs and benefits. This allows us to solve the firm's profit maximization decision, "The Firm's Problem", in markets more realistic than the model of perfect competition we've used so far. </p>
                <br>
                <p> Armed with these tools we can look at markets with one, few, or many sellers, selling in markets with homogeneous or branded goods. </p>
