            <p>
                Last time our small-scale organic farmer Molly was growing spinach and/or carrots. We found her PPF using what we knew about her farm's productivity. 
            <p>
                It turns out Molly has been working <b>10</b> hours per day, but like many people during COVID, she realizes she's burnt out and needs to spend less time working. She decides to spend only <b>8</b> hours per day on her farm, which means she is now only able to grow on <b>45</b> of her <b>100</b> hectare farm. With this new work schedule she can only farm <b>80</b> hectares. Her productive capacity has dropped to either <b>4</b> carrots or <b>36</b> spinach.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                This may seem like bad news for Molly’s wallet. And it could have been. But it turns out that later that winter she comes across a new carrot harvesting technology that would double her carrot harvest. With this technology she's able to grow up to <b>8</b> carrots. This turns out to pivot the PPF out on the carrot axis.

            <p>
                So what’s happened here? A change in Molly’s labor input has changed the output of her farm. The frontier depends on the level of labor. The more labor, the more is possible. And in this case since there's less labor, less is possible. And in addition to labor, the PPF also captures changes in technology. These changes in the PPF aren’t purely mathematical. What we’ve found is a region that used to be inefficient that is now unattainable. And a region that used to be unatainable that is not on the fronteir.
            </p>
            <p>
                Molly’s PPF depends on how much labor goes into her farm, and the efficiency of her technology. Which means that her PPF shifts in response to changes in labor and technology. But to do this, inputs had to change. But if this discussion leaves you wondering if there’s some way to exceed the PPF without changing inputs, using only our choices, you're probably in the right class. And of course as it turns out there’s a more profound insight, a way to exceed the frontier without changing inputs or technology. But it requires some more math and a journey into 1800s Britain.

            <h3>Guilding</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            <p>
                It turns out Molly isn’t the only farmer in the area. Another farmer, Andrew, operates another small scale organic farm next to Molly’s. He also is good at growing carrots and spinach. He can grow <b>4</b> tons of carrots per year and <b>18</b> tons of spinach per year on a similar <b>100</b> hectare farm. Molly is also able to produce more of both goods, so she has the absolute advantage in both carrots and spinach.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Molly and Andrew decide to form a local farmers guild, operating their respective farms but shipping their produce together. Let's say the guild decides that both farms will produce the same ratio of carrots and spinach. Dividing their farms equally between crops, Andrew will produce  2  carrots and  9  spinach, and Molly will produce  2.5  carrots and  22.5  spinach. This adds up to  4.5  carrots and  31.5  spinach. Under this regime, the guild's PPF is just a line running through the guild's extreme points  9  carrots and  63  spinach, just the extreme points for the two farms added together.
            </p>
            <p>
                But Molly, having studied economics in college realizes that opportunity cost might be important to consider when choosing their crops. Like we did for Molly, Andrew’s opportunity cost of carrots is  92  spinach. Again, this is visualized by Andrew's steeper PPF, meaning he gives up more carrots for each ton of spinach relative to Molly.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So Molly has a lower opportunity cost of carrots and Andrew has a lower opportunity cost of spinach. Molly has to give up  19  units of carrots for every  1  unit of spinach, and Andrew has to give up  29  units of carrots for every  1  unit of spinach. So Andrew is relatively less efficient at growing spinach because he’s giving up more carrots to grow it. And Andrew, therefore, is relatively more efficient at growing carrots since he's giving up less spinach to grow it. This is the flip side of the opportunity cost equation we used at the beginning of the video. Andrew's next best use of his land is less costly when growing carrots even though Molly is better at growing carrots. This is because she is much better at growing spinach than Andrew. This is one of those important and somewhat unintuitive idea's you'll run into periodically in economics.
            </p>
            <p>
               Maybe pause here and convince yourself that even though Molly is better at growing both goods, Andrew has a lower opportunity cost of growing carrots than Molly. He is gives up less than she does to grow carrots.

            <h3>Comparative Advantage</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            <p>
                Having a lower opportunity cost is what we call comparative advantage. And here, Andrew has a comparative advantage in carrots, and Molly has a comparative advantage in spinach. As you might have seen before, there is an important mathematical realization here. When one farmer’s opportunity cost is lower in one crop, the other farmer’s opportunity cost will always be lower in the other.
            </p>
            
            <video class="animation_wrap" width="560" height="315" autoplay muted controls loop>

            </video>
            
            <p>
                So Molly realizes that maybe there’s something to this idea, that maybe the guild should be minimizing their joint opportunity cost. So she and Andrew decide to specialize in what each farmer is relatively most efficient at growing, what they have a comparative advantage in. So Molly grows only spinach, growing  45 . And Andrew grows only carrots, growing  4 . 
            </p>
            <p>
                And we can check our work here by checking what happens to our production when we specialize in the good we don't have the comparative advantage in. And our production point is inside the guild's equal-split PPF, so we've correctly chosen the specialization according to comparative advantage.
            </p>
            
            <video class="animation_wrap" width="560" height="315" autoplay muted controls loop>

            </video>
            
            <p>
                So without changing any technology, simply by choosing their crop according to their comparative advantage, the local farmers guild was able to exceed the frontier. Its a more general truth that so long as we're not too close to the edges, we can exceed any point on the PPF with specialization. The limit to this is when one farmer produces all of the good they don't have a comparative advantage in.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why is this true? We’ve found the tradeoffs underlying the farmers’ crop choices, and we chose crops that minimize costs. Andrew has a lower opportunity cost of carrots. He gives up less to grow carrots, and Molly gives up less to grow spinach. So specializing in the lower opportunity cost crop makes the guild do better than a simple split.
            </p>
            <p>
                This tells us something deep about opportunity cost, that by making choices together that minimize opportunity cost can make Molly and Andrew better off jointly. But possibly you're still concerned that the GROUP is better off but one of the INDIVIDUALS in the group may not be. We were slightly concerned that maybe we were sacrificing the individual for the benefit of the group. So let's turn to the model proposed by David Ricardo in 1817 to explain how specialization and trade can make two countries better off.

            <h3>Coordination Using Prices / Specialization and Trade</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            <p>
                So far we’ve looked at a type of cooperation between two individuals. Here the setup here is a little different, where instead of forming a guild together, they both aim to maximize their own harvest individually. This is where the real magic happens. So to model this environment, we'll set up two PPFs one for Molly and one for Andrew.
            </p>
            <p>
                Production for the two farms together in a guild was better off, but could we exceed the frontier of both farms individually at the same time? Is there some coordination device that would make this possible? The answer here again is YES!
            </p>
            <p>
                In autarky the farmers don't trade with each other and, like before, these PPFs represent the frontier for each farm. In autarky, then, Molly can grow  5  tons of carrots OR  45  tons of spinach while Andrew can grow  4  tons of carrots OR  18  tons of spinach. Lets pick a point in autarky and see if we can do better with trade, say  1  ton of carrots and  36  tons of spinach for Molly, and  3  tons of carrots and  7  tons of spinach for Andrew.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So what if we realized that since we could exceed the joint PPF from last time, we wondered if we could make both farms better off simultaneously. We have a hunch that since minimizing opportunity cost by specializing according to comparative advantage improves the whole, that we might be able to follow a similar program and improve both farmers. But additionally, to give both farmers access to both crops, we also need to trade.
            </p>
            
            <video class="animation_wrap" width="560" height="315" autoplay muted controls loop>

            </video>
            
            <p>
                The first thing to realize when we're thinking about trading is that each farmer can perform a sort of trade with themself. Each farmer could, if they wanted to, switch part of their farm from the crop they're growing under specialization to the other good. Thought of as a trade, this exchange is exactly equal to their opportunity cost, and is what the PPF tells us. So we're looking for any trade that is more favorable than their PPF. We can represent this with a line. As long as the trade lives outside the farmer's PPF, the trade benefits them.
            </p>
            <p>
                To visualize this trade we just need to realize that when we give up the good that we're specializing in, we also receive the other good in exchange. This lets us view the trade as a downward sloping relationship between the two goods, where the slope represents the exchange rate. And this is going to look very similar to a PPF except it's not going to intercept our two extremes. It's just going to run through the point where we're currently producing.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the trade line lies below the PPF, the trade doesn't do better than the PPF for the farmer. So we'll only highlight the acheivable area made possible by the trade. We also need to realize that not every trade is feasible, though, since the other farmer can only away what they're harvesting. So we constrain the trade line on its upper end as well. This leaves us with a line representing the PPF as well as a line representing the range of possible trades.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the trade line lies below the PPF, the trade doesn't do better than the PPF for the farmer. So we'll only highlight the acheivable area made possible by the trade.

            </p>
            <p>
                And second, we can choose how much of each goods the farmers grow. Earlier we showed that Molly has a comparative advantage and spinach and Andrew has a comparative advantage in carrots so each is gonna specialize in each of these two goods. Each farmer specializing according to their comparative advantage, Molly harvests  45  tons of spinach and Andrew harvests  4  units of carrots. This is like the guild solution, but here we're looking for a trade that makes both farmers better off. And it's important to note here that we STILL haven't imposed preferences. All we're looking at is the frontier, and asking if we can find a way to live outside it without changing inputs.
            </p>
            <p>
                As Molly shifts toward her specialty crop, she's able to trade more of her speciaty to Andrew, and Andrew is able to exchange for more of the good not his specialty. But the real magic happens when we move both Molly AND Andrew toward their specialty's, extending the range of possible trades.
            </p>
            <p>
                At this point it becomes clarifying when we plot the trade lines on one graph for the farmers together.
            </p>
            <p>
                Returning to the challenge we set out on, specializing, exchanging  𝐶  carrot for  𝑆  spinach sets the exchange rate to  𝑋 , which works for both farmers, means both farmers have more of both goods than they had in autarky.
            </p>
            <p>
                It turns out in both goods both farmers are doing better than they were before. So not only have we improved the group as a whole but we've also improved each individual farmer by choosing the appropriate exchange rate. This isn’t some mathematical sleight of hand. No matter what the original production levels were, as long as both farmers have different productive capabilities, we can always do better for a range of points on the PPF with specialization and trade. We’ve chosen the original values to make the math work out cleanly. But there’s nothing special about them.
            </p>
            <p>
                One question I'll leave you with: can we always find a trade like this?
            </p>
            <p>
                We’ve done something extraordinary here. If this doesn’t spark your interest in the field, I’m not sure I can help you! We’ve shown that two types of coordination, guilding and trading, not only increase the total harvest, but also can increase the crops for each farmer individually. And we did this simply by realizing that tradeoffs are important, and that exchanges that take advantage of opportunity cost and comparative advantage mean cooperation can make both farmers better off without giving up any harvest in the process. We’ve just put numbers to something that at the outset might have sounded impossible.
            </p>
            <p>
                Interaction between decisionmakers like this is central to what we do in microeconomics. Welcome! We have a lot to do.
