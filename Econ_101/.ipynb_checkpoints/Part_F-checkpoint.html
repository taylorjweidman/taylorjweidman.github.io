        <p>
           <a>Part F</a> asks the question what we should do when we can't have everything. To do this we build a model of buyer's income using <a>Factor Markets</a> and the <a>Labor Market</a>. This links the market for <a>Final Goods</a> to buyer's labor income. We use this income along with prices in the final goods market to build the <a>Budget Constraint</a>. Buyers aim to maximize their preferences, which we model by ranking all possible alternatives and assigning higher ranked alternatives a higher number. This ranking using numbers is what we call <a>Utility</a>. We used a contour plot to show that an <a>Indifference Curve</a> walks us across equally preferred goods, like we're walking around a mountain without gaining or losing elevation. The solution to the <a>Consumer's Problem</a> maximizes Utility when we have climbed to the highest indifference curve while remaining within the budget constraint. This happens when the <a>Marginal Rate of Substitution</a> equals the <a>Marginal Rate of Transformation</a>.

            This closes out the semester! This course has charted a path through economic theory relying on our models of why buyers and sellers choose to interact. In <a>Part A</a> we started by building a model of the gains from trade using <a>Opportunity Cost</a> and <a>Specialization</a>. In <a>Part B</a> we introduced markets as a way to coordinate where on the PPF to live and used buyers' preferences with the demand curve and sellers' costs with the supply curve to give us equilibrium. In <a>Part C</a> and <a>Part D</a> we showed how markets can fail and how governments can fix market failures. Then we developed a more sophisticated model of the supply curve using the incentives faced by sellers. <a>Part F</a> wraps up this course through economic theory by doing a similar thing for buyers, generating the demand curve from the incentives faced by buyers.

        <p>
            Start Part F by skimming the chapters to develop an understanding of the scope of what's being discussed. Then reread in more detail.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Once you've finished reading, take a look at the practice material and use the text as a resource when you need help. This way, you know what's most important, get to practicing quickly, and know where to find help when you innevitably get stuck.

            Demo F is very similar to what you'll see on MiniExam F. This is a resource for you to use as you'd like. But here's my advice. Start by trying to solve Demo F on your own. Then once you've worked through everything as best you're able, use the video and solutions to check your work. You're more than welcome to watch this video first, but you're not going to catch your weak points as easily, which is the main point.

            MiniExam F will last 20 minutes and will be held during the scheduled finals period (see syllabus), covering everything in Part F. If you're able to do the work in the Homework, understand the concepts, and can solve the MiniExam Demo, you're going to be in good shape.
