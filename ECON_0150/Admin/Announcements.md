#### Economic Data Analysis: Week 1 (important: room change)

Hi folks,

Welcome back to campus! And welcome to economic data analysis. Its difficult to overstate the value of data for building and testing economic models. This course is designed to equip you with the skills to analyze, interpret, and communicate economic data. If you have any interest in building economic models of decisionmaking, this may be the most important class you take in college. We will focus on understanding the statistical tools economists use and how we apply them to data. 

Yesterday the department changed our room to Posvar 4900 (from Lawrence 105) and it may not be updated yet in peoplesoft. It's right outside the Econ department. So give yourself a few extra minutes to find the correct room.

I'm excited for this class and I look forward to meeting you!
