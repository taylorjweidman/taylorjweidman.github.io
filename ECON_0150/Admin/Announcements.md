#### Economic Data Analysis: Week 1 (important: room change)

Hi folks,

Welcome back to campus! And welcome to economic data analysis. Its difficult to overstate the value of data for building and testing economic models. This course is designed to equip you with the skills to analyze, interpret, and communicate economic data. If you have any interest in building economic models of decisionmaking, this may be the most important class you take in college. We will focus on understanding the statistical tools economists use and how we apply them to data. 

Yesterday the department changed our room to Posvar 4900 (from Lawrence 105) and it may not be updated yet in peoplesoft. It's right outside the Econ department. So give yourself a few extra minutes to find the correct room.

I'm excited for this class and I look forward to meeting you!

#### Economic Data Analysis: Week 4 (first MiniExam)

Hi folks,

Just wanted to say it's been nice meeting you the past few weeks. I hope you've been enjoying beginning to start working with the basic toolset of exploratory data analysis. This is the first step in building the full pipeline for how we build models with data in the field. This coming week we're going to start developing more advanced skills for working with univariate data before we turn to exploring relationships between variables. 

I've just posted Homework 03 on the Part 1 page. Feel free to get started as soon as you'd like. We'll also be working on some of the core skills in class this week.

The first thing we're doing in class this week is taking MiniExam 01. The intention with MiniExams is to keep the assessments frequent so you 1) can always feel on track and 2) to lower the pressure at any one point in the semester. The downside is that they will generally be weekly, which means its important to stay current with the class, which can be a bit of extra work on your part. A couple of things to remember about MiniExams this semester:

- First, they are short, about 8-10 minutes. 
- Second, we'll take many of them this semester, so none of them should keep you up at night. You can drop your lowest 3.
- Third, they are open note (no electronics), so feel free to create note sheets for each one.
- Fourth, you'll find that you'll be in good shape if you feel comfortable with the skills and concepts we're developing.
- Fifth, they will all be on paper, so I'm not going to ask you direct coding questions.

Anyway, I hope this offers some extra guidance for the first MiniExam this coming week. Let me know if you have any questions!

Yours,

Taylor

#### Economic Data Analysis: Week 5 (starting Part 2; MiniExam 02; Homework 04)

Hi folks,

Welcome to week 5. We're on a direct path toward building statistical models of behavior. We've nearly wrapped up Part 1, exploring univariate data, exploring variable types and data structures, and filtering, grouping, and transforming variables. Before building the intuition for all the models that will come later, this week we'll start exploring multivariate data in Part 2.

Also, MiniExam 02 will be the first thing we do this week, focusing on filtering, grouping, and transforming data. While ME 01 tested your ability to identify data types and choose visualizations, ME 02 will ask you to apply the data manipulation skills we've been practicing.

Just like our previous homework and in-class examples prepared you for ME 01, our recent exercises have given you direct practice with the skills you'll need for ME 02. You've already worked with these concepts â€“ now you'll show what you've learned. Remember, it's 8 minutes, so not hugely taxing.

Anyway, I hope the weekend has been lovely! See ya soon.

Yours,

Taylor
