## ECON 0150 | Spring 2025 | Log

#### Jan 24

Students had a lot of trouble getting set up with colab. Most of it was just using basic syntax with strings and file systems and such. I think it would be helpful to do demos with code to fall back on, but creating the notebook from scratch. 

I also want to use data from econ papers when we start building models. I think that would be SOOO cool.

I also don't think the intro sequence is in the right order. I feel I'm losing students interests early on by spending too much time on the simple stuff before getting into the cool stuff. Maybe there's a way to really lock students in with an example. I like the survey idea. But it's not really coming through at the moment. 

I think it also might be good to post a python demo and have students come to the second class having gone through it. 

Maybe it would be best to start with data structures, then talk about data types. So it would be, here's cross-section, time series, and panel. Then we're going to focus on cross section in the survey. Talk about the different types of variables. 

Maybe it would make sense to call the exercises "startup exercises". I'm trying to organize the startup in a way to justifies the exercises as distinct from the examples. 

Maybe Part 1.0 is about organizing data into structures and types. Then call the exercises "examples". Then we go into more detail about thinking about categorical variables in Part 1.1 and so on.

Then I'll call Part 0 the survey demo that we'll do on day one. This demo would include discussion of data types and structures, univariate data, multivariate data, a t-test, a regression, and a fixed effect. 

Then Day Two would start on Part 1.0 with the exercises.
