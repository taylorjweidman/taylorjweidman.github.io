  - “By the end of this course, you will be able to:
    1. Summarize and visualize different types of data.
    2. Build and interpret statistical models (regression, GLM, etc.).
    3. Communicate data insights clearly in both written and oral form.”

## 3. Overview of the Course Arc

    1. **Part 1**: Summary Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    2. **Part 2**: Pattern EDA
    3. **Part 3**: Building Linear Models
    4. **Part 4**: The General Linear Model
    5. **Part 5**: Advanced GLM
    6. **Part 6**: Communicating with Data
- **Slide 7**: **Visual Roadmap**
  - Show a simple flowchart or timeline illustrating how we’ll progress from simple data summaries to advanced modeling and then to final communication.

## 4. Part-by-Part Preview (with brief examples)

Give a quick sense of what each part looks like in practice.

1. **Part 1: Summary Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - **Key Themes**: Summaries, tables, histograms, boxplots.
   - **Conceptual Example**: “We’ll take a dataset of wages, create a histogram, and see if it’s skewed or normally distributed. We’ll also create summary stats to understand our sample.”
2. **Part 2: Pattern Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - **Key Themes**: Visualizing relationships between variables, correlation, basic regression.
   - **Conceptual Example**: “We might explore the relationship between education level and wages with a scatter plot, then see if there’s a pattern or trend.”
3. **Part 3: Building Linear Models**
   - **Key Themes**: Sampling variation, the Central Limit Theorem, simple linear regression (single predictor).
   - **Conceptual Example**: “We test if the observed wage-education trend is real or just noise by building a basic regression model and interpreting a p-value.”
4. **Part 4: The General Linear Model**
   - **Key Themes**: Multiple predictors, categorical variables (dummy variables), interactions, residual analysis.
   - **Conceptual Example**: “Add multiple variables (e.g., experience, region) into the wage-education model, see how they collectively affect wages, and visualize residuals.”
5. **Part 5: Advanced GLM**
   - **Key Themes**: Binary outcomes, time series, repeated measures.
   - **Conceptual Example**: “Analyzing whether someone is employed or not (binary logistic regression) or wages over time (time series). Learn to pick the right model for the right data type.”
6. **Part 6: Communicating with Data**
   - **Key Themes**: Clear narratives, effective visualization, presentation skills.
   - **Conceptual Example**: “Turning your analysis of wages and employment into a coherent story: How do we choose the best charts and structure slides to explain our findings?”

## 5. Course Logistics

- **Slide 8**: **Resources & Tools**
  - Software: Excel + Python (no experience required!)
  - Office hours, TA info (Jacob Stenstrom, [dcy14@pitt.edu](mailto:dcy14@pitt.edu)), and recommended textbooks (Fife, Cairo, Koop).
- **Slide 9**: **Grading Breakdown**
  - Homework (10%)
    - Due Fridays at 5PM, practice-based.
    - Lowest three dropped.
  - MiniExams (70%)
    - Weekly in-class, first 10 minutes.
    - Mostly on material from the previous week.
    - Open-book, open-note (no electronics).
    - Lowest three dropped.
  - Final Capstone (20%)
    - Presentation + paper.
    - Demonstrate data analysis from start to finish.
- **Slide 10**: **Important Policies**
  - **Email Policy**: Response times, how to ask concise questions.
  - **AI Policy**: Encouraged to use for learning but must produce your own work.
  - **Academic Conduct**: Honesty and integrity are essential.

## 6. Looking Ahead: Your First Assignments

- **Slide 11**: **Immediate Next Steps**
  - Remind them of any upcoming tasks (e.g., “Check Canvas for the first Homework posted, due Friday 5PM”).
  - Let them know when the **first MiniExam** will be.
- **Slide 12**: **Getting Set Up**
  - Instructions for installing Python (Anaconda, etc.) or how to access Excel.
  - Encourage exploring the recommended online resources for Python/pandas.

## 7. Quick Interactive Activity (Optional)

- Slide 13

  : 

  Mini Warm-Up

  - Example: Show a small dataset (or a chart) and ask students, “What do you notice? What questions come to mind?”
  - Use this to illustrate how we’ll approach data exploration throughout the semester.

## 8. Q&A and Wrap-Up

- **Slide 14**: **Questions?**
  - Encourage students to ask any lingering questions about the syllabus or course policies.
  - Reiterate office hours and that you’re there to help.
- **Slide 15**: **Final Thoughts / Thank You**
  - End on a friendly note—“I look forward to exploring economic data with you this semester!”

### Final Tips

1. **Keep it Interactive**
   - If time allows, weave in short discussion prompts or quick reflection questions to spark student interest right away.
2. **Highlight the Path**
   - Return to your “roadmap” frequently throughout the semester so students see how each part connects to the larger arc.
3. **Set the Tone**
   - Emphasize that the class is about **learning by doing**—students should expect to work with real data, ask lots of questions, and apply the concepts hands-on.

Good luck with your first day!
