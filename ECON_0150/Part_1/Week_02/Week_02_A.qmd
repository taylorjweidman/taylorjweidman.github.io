## Variable Types
<p class="subheader">Categorical variable types</p>

**Binary**: two categories (yes/no; true/false)

- *Employment Status (Employed, Unemployed)*

**Nominal**: no inherent order
  
- *Employment Sector (Agriculture, Services, Unemployed).*

**Ordinal**: meaningful order without consistent interval.
  
- *Economic Optimism (Very Pessimistic to Very Optimistic).*

---

## Variable Types
<p class="subheader">Numerical/Quantitative variable types</p>

**Discrete**: countable numbers with meaningful intervals

- *Number of Children in a Household.*

**Continuous**: quantities measurable on the reals.

- *Household Income in USD.*

---

## Example: Household Employment
