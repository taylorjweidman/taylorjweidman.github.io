```{.python code-line-numbers="4,7"}
# Find the data in either the US or in Canada

# Method 1: Using isin()
df[df['COUNTRY_CODE'].isin(['US', 'CN'])]

# Method 2: Using OR operator
df[(df['COUNTRY_CODE'] == 'US') | (df['COUNTRY_CODE'] == 'CN')]

## Part 1.5 | Filtering Data by Inequality
<p class="subheader">Filtering continuous data requires using inequalities.</p>

. . .

| Symbol | Python | | Example |
|--------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| = | == | | `df[df['age'] == 25]` |
| ≠ | != | | `df[df['age'] != 25]` |
| < | < | | `df[df['age'] < 25]` |
| > | > | | `df[df['age'] > 25]` |
| ≤ | <= | | `df[df['age'] <= 25]` |
| ≥ | >= | | `df[df['age'] >= 25]` |
