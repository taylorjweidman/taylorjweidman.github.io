## ECON 0150 | Spring 2025 | Homework 05 + 06

### Due: Friday, Feb 21, 5PM

Homework is designed to both test your knowledge and challenge you to apply familiar concepts in new applications. Answer clearly and completely. You are welcomed and encouraged to work in groups so long as your work is your own. Use the provided datasets to answer the following questions. Then submit your figures and answers to Gradescope.

#### Q1. US Cities Analysis

Using the provided dataset of US cities that includes:
* City name
* Population
* Latitude/longitude coordinates
* Average temperature

a) Plot all city locations (using lat/lng) on a scatterplot (which represents a map in this case). In a separate color, on the same figure, plot all cities in the 'America/New_York' timezone. Feel free to represent the population of the city with the size of the point.

b) Create a scatter plot showing the relationship between latitude and average temperature for cities in the 'America/New_York' timezone. How would you describe this relationship?

- Strongly Positive
- Weakly Positive
- Unclear
- Weakly Negative
- Strongly Negative

#### Q2. Sampling and Confidence Intervals

Using the provided dataset of customer wait times (in minutes) from two different restaurant locations:

a) Create histograms of wait times from both locations on the same figure. Add vertical lines showing the mean wait time for each location. Use appropriate colors and labels to make the comparison clear.

b) For Location A, draw 100 random samples of size 30 and calculate the mean of each sample. Create a histogram of these sample means. 

c) Calculate and visualize the 95% confidence interval for the true mean wait time at Location A.

#### Q3. Hypothesis Testing

A restaurant chain claims their mean delivery time is 30 minutes. Using the provided dataset of actual delivery times:

a) State the null and alternative hypotheses for testing whether the true mean delivery time is different from 30 minutes.

b) Use python to calculate the sample mean and standard error and to conduct a hypothesis test.

c) Create a visualization that shows:
   - A histogram of the delivery times
   - A vertical line at the hypothesized mean (30 minutes)
   - The observed sample mean
   - The critical values for Î± = 0.05

Explain in one sentence whether you reject the null hypothesis and why.

Remember to include appropriate titles, labels, and units in all visualizations. Submit your Python code, figures, and written responses to Gradescope.
